\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have assessed the sensitivity to mSUGRA of a generic signal characterized by two isolated, high $p_T$ leptons,
significant jet activity, and \met. We perform a scan of the mSUGRA $m_{0}-m_{1/2}$ parameter space and determine 
the expected excluded region in the case of no observed signal as well as the $5\sigma$ sensitivity reach for both SS
and OS dileptons, assuming integrated luminosities of 100/pb and 1/fb. Our results indicate that we are sensitive to a
significant region of the mSUGRA parameter space which extends upon previous results from the Tevatron.
