\section{Event Selection}
\label{sec:eventselection}

The event selection used is not optimized for any specific SUSY scenario.
It is based on small modifications to the dilepton event selections 
that we used in recently approved 
$WW$\cite{ww} and \ttbar\cite{ttbar} cross-section
analyses.  A quick summary of the event selection is:
\begin{itemize}
\item The event is required to pass the single $e$ or $\mu$  triggers.
\item Two isolated, same or opposite sign leptons ($ee$, $e\mu$, and $\mu\mu$). 
\item Leptons must have $P_T > 10$ GeV, $|\eta|< 2.4$ and at least one of them must have $P_T > 20$ GeV.
\item For SS analyses, we veto the candidate lepton, if an extra lepton in the event, pairs with the candidate lepton
to form a $Z$ within the mass range between $76 < m_{\ell\ell} $ (GeV) $< 106$. This requirement is 
designed to reject $WZ$ events.
\item At least three L2L3 corrected caloJets with $P_T > 30$ GeV and $|\eta|< 2.4$.
\item The scalar sum of the $P_T$ of all jets passing the requirements above should be $>$ 200 GeV.
\item We require \met~$>$ 80 GeV. 
\item -------- NEED TO OUTLINE THE OS SELECTION AS WELL HERE IN SOME DETAILS ----------
\end{itemize}
\noindent The details of the lepton and trigger selections are given below.

\subsection{Electron Selection}
\label{sec:electron}

\begin{itemize}
\item The electron ID is the ``e-gamma category based looseID''.
\item No muon candidate within $\Delta R < 0.1$.
\item $|d_0| < 200~\mu m$ (corrected for beamspot).
\item Iso $<$ 0.1, where Iso=Sum/Max(20 GeV, $P_T$), and Sum = tkIso + hcalIso +  Max(0 GeV, ecalIso - 2GeV).
All isolation sums are the standard sums used in release 3\_1\_X from the egamma group (cone of
0.4 for ecal, jurassic, rec-hit based; cone of 0.3 for tracker, and cone of 0.4 for hcal).
\item Conversion rejection~\cite{conversion} using tracks within cone of 0.3 of the candidate electron for SS studies: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|\Delta \cot\theta| < 0.02$; the difference between cotangent polar angles of tracks parallel to 
each other.
\item $|d_{2d}| < 0.02$ cm; the two dimensional distance between points within nearest tracks.
\item The charge of the associated GSF and CTF tracks must be consistent.
If the CTF track is not reconstructed, the electron is kept.
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Muon Selection}
\label{sec:muon}
\begin{itemize}
\item Must be a global muon {\bf and} a tracker muon~\cite{glbtrk}.
\item GlobalMuonPromptTight (global $\chi^2$/ndof$<$10)~\cite{muonid}.
\item At least 11 valid hits for the silicon track~\cite{muonid}.
\item $|d_0| < 200~\mu m$ (from silicon track, corrected for beamspot).
\item Global fits must have hits in the muon chambers.
\item Minimum ionizing: EcalVetoEnergy $<$ 4 GeV and HcalVetoEnergy $<6$ GeV~\cite{vplusj}. 
\item Iso $<$ 0.1, where Iso=Sum/Max(20 GeV, $P_T$), and Sum = tkIso + hcalIso +  ecalIso.
All isolation sums are the standard sums stored in the muon object in release 3\_1\_X, and
are calculated in a cone of 0.3.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trigger Selection}
\label{sec:trigger}
We use inclusive lepton triggers with no isolation, $i.e.$, the logical OR of {\tt HLT\_Ele15\_SW\_L1R} and {\tt HLT\_Mu9}.  
The combined trigger efficiency is $\sim 99$\% for dilepton events that pass the event selection.
These triggers are expected to be present in the data taking trigger table.
