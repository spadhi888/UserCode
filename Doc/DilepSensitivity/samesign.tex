\section{Same Sign Dileptons}
\label{sec:samesign}

This section summarizes the results of the SUSY parameter space scan
in the same sign di-lepton channel. The measurement stratzgy is  
described in details in a CMS note~\cite{ssnote}. The technique
utilizes two data-driven methods to estimate background characterized
by the presence of two high $P_T$, isolated, same sign leptons,
$\met$, and significant hadronic activity.  For the purposes
of this note we restrict ourselves to the $ee$, $e\mu$, and $\mu\mu$
final states, {\em i.e.}, we do not consider $\tau$'s, except in the
case that the $\tau$ decays leptonically. 

As we will show in Section~\ref{sec:ssyields}, for a reasonable event
selection the main background is from \ttbar decays. The data-driven background 
prediction is based on a combination of estimating ``fake leptons''\cite{fakenote} (FakeRate) 
and electrons reconstructed with the wrong sign\cite{ssnote} (Charge FlipRate). The probability
for muons to be reconstructed with the wrong sign at the relevant momenta is negligible.

\subsection{Event Yields}
\label{sec:ssyields}

The expected SM event yields in 100~pb$^{-1}$ after applying the event selections
described in Section~\ref{sec:eventselection} to the data sets described in
Section~\ref{sec:datasamples} are detailed below

The dominant SM contribution is from \ttbar decays. The total estimated background 
is obtained after the application of Fake and Charge Flip rate to the entire ensamble
of SM samples. The results of the application of the procedure is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:sm_preditcion}.

\subsection{Procedure for Determining $5\sigma$ Discovery Reach}
\label{sec:significance}

The $5\sigma$  discovery reach is estimated in the $m_{0}-m_{1/2}$
plane by  performing our analysis at each of the  mSUGRA scan points.
Expected event yield is determined based on the number of events passing
all cuts and scaled by the LO cross section for that point with 100/pb or 1/fb
of simulated events respectively . We apply both of the above mentioned data-driven 
estimation procedures to determine the ``signal contamination'' at each of the benchmark points. 
The significance if quantified by the observed yield and the predicted background
using estimators: $Z_{Bi}$~\cite{cite:cousins}  and $Z_{N}$\cite{cite:conway}. Following
are used in order to compute the significance.
\begin{itemize}
\item The predicted background yield
\item The relative systematic  uncertainty on the predicted background
yield (set to 50\%)
\item The  statistical uncertainty  on the predicted  background yield
($Z_N$ only, set to 0)
\item The observed yield
\end{itemize}
Figure~\ref{fig:ss_zn} and Figure~\ref{fig:ss_zbi} shows the discovery reach for various 
luminosity scenarios in one of the mSUGRA planes using $Z_{N}$ and $Z_{Bi}$ respectively.
Clearly, a large region of phase space can be accessed using higher luminosity.

\subsection{Procedure for Excluding a Region of the mSUGRA Parameter Space}
\label{sec:exclusion}

Next we  determine the region of  the mSUGRA parameter  space which we
expect  to exclude  at 95\%  confidence level  (CL) if  we see
the standard model (SM) expected yields in data. 
We  assume  that  we find  the  same
predicted background yield  and observed yield in data  that we expect
to  find based on  our SM  MC. However, as the latter is 0.4,
we work the math for both an observation of 0 or 1 events in 100/pb.
We  use this  information to  exclude a subset of the mSUGRA points using 
the following procedure.

The first  step is to  determine the 95\%  CL upper limit (UL)  on the
signal yield using a Bayesian  method from John Conway, implemented in
the program bayes.f. The required  inputs are: the observed yield, the
relative  uncertainty in  the  signal acceptance  (set  to 15\%),  the
predicted  background yield,  and  the total  error  on the  predicted
background yield. We assume $0.4 \pm 0.6$ for background yield and 
its uncertainty.
\vspace{3 mm}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}

\includegraphics[width=0.485\linewidth]{figs/exclusion100ss.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.485\linewidth]{figs/exclusion1fbss.eps}
\caption{ $m_{0}-m_{1/2}$ exclusion plot at the 95 \% C.L in the framework of 
mSUGRA assuming R-parity conservation using an  integrated  luminosity of  
$100~\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$ (left) and $1~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ (right). The blue region
was excluded by the CDF experiment [xx]. The black hashed region was excluded
by the LEP experiments [xx].\label{fig:ss_exclusion}}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

These values lead to 
to  95\% CL  ULs  of 3.2 and 4.7  signal  events respectively for an assumed 
observation of 0 or 1 events.

Next, we  wish to exclude mSUGRA  points based on the  signal yield UL
derived above.   The most obvious  way to do  so is to  exclude points
which  lead  to a  difference  between  observed  yield and  predicted
background yield  which exceeds the  UL on the signal  yield. 
As the effect of signal contamination is small, we stick to this simplest 
of possible ways.
