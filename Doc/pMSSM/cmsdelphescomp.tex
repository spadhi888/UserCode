\section{Comparison of kinematic quantities with Full Simulation}
\label{sec:cmsdelphescomp}
We compare the important kinematic variables used for the study with the CMSSW 
Full simulation using LM1 benchmark point. Figures~\ref{fig:njetht},~\ref{fig:jetpteta},~\ref{fig:alphat}
shows that the simulation/reconstruction infrastructure used agree well with the full simulation.
