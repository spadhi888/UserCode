\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented the first interpretation within the framework of the phenomenological MSSM---a sufficiently generic and well-motivated 19-dimensional parameterization of SUSY defined at the SUSY scale---of the 35 pb$^{-1}$ of CMS data collected in 2010.  We have used three well-developed CMS SUSY analyses, namely, the di-jet $\alpha_T$, opposite-sign dilepton and same-sign di-lepton analyses for this purpose, and expressed our results in terms of likelihood ratios.  We have demonstrated that the interpretation of CMS data in terms of broad classes of multi-parameter SUSY models is feasible with the currently available computational and statistical tools, and that it is indeed possible to make meaningful statements on the natures of such models and therefore on supersymmetry, in general.
