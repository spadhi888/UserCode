\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented the first interpretation of 35 pb$^{-1}$ CMS data collected in 2010 within the framework of phenomenological MSSM, which is a sufficiently generic and well-motivated 19-dimensional parameterization of SUSY defined at the SUSY scale.  We have used three well-developed CMS SUSY analyses, namely, di-jet $\alpha_T$, opposite-sign dilepton and same-sign di-lepton for this purpose, and expressed our results in terms of likelihood ratios.  We have demonstrated that interpretation of CMS data in terms of broad classes of multi-parameter SUSY models is feasible with the currently available statistical tools, and that it is indeed possible to make meaningful statements on the natures of such models.
