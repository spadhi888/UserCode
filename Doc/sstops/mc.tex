\section{Monte Carlo event generation}
\label{sec:mc}


We used the external model interface in MadGraph~\cite{madgraph} 
to generate $pp \to tt$ and $pp \to ttj$ at LO 
using the lagrangian of equation 1 with
different values of 
the $Z'$ mass, and with $f_L = 0$, $f_R = 1$.  
{\bf List the values of the Z' mass that we simulated.}

Different
values of $f_R$ are modelled by rescaling the cross-sections
for the t-channel (Fig.~\ref{fig:tchannel}) and 
s-channel (Fig.~\ref{fig:schannel}) by $f_R^4$ and $f_R^2$,
respectively.  We used the 
CTEQ6L~\cite{cteq6l} parton distribution function (PDF). 
The renormalization and factorization scales are chosen 
to be at the top mass scale ($m_{t} = 172.5$ GeV). 
The width of the $Z'$ boson is computed using 
BRIDGE~\cite{bridge} and verified using MadGraph~\cite{madgraph}. 

The total production cross sections for $tt$ and $ttj$ 
at the leading-order (LO) are shown as a function of $Z'$ 
mass in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:sstopcross}. 
Our calculated cross sections agree well with the 
published literature~\cite{berger}.

The events generated by MadGraph are then fed to Pythia for 
parton showering.  They are simulated using the standard CMS
fast-simulation program.
