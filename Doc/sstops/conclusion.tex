\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, the first results on same sign top pair production using 
di-leptons have been presented. 
In the proton-proton collision data sample corresponding to an 
integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$ at at $\sqrt{s} = 7 $ TeV, 
no significant deviations from the standard model expectations are observed. 
We us these data to set a cross-section limit $\sigma(pp \to tt) < 0.3$ pb at the 95\% C.L..
In addition, for a model with a 
a non-universal massive neutral vector boson ($Z'$), we exclude 
a region of the $M(Z')-f_R$ parameter space, where $M(Z')$ is the mass of the $Z'$ 
and $f_R$ is the strength of the right handed $utZ'$ coupling.


%For the chosen sets of couplings, $Z'$ masses below 2 TeV using t-channel exchange diagrams and below 510 GeV 
%for $ttj$ production at the LHC are excluded at 95\% CL. 
% These results exceed previous limits set by any other experiment.
