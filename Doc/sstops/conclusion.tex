\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In summary, the first results on searches for same sign top pair production using di-leptons have
been presented. In the data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$, no significant
deviations from the standard model expectations are observed. Limits on the cross sections for new physics
involving $tt$ and $ttj$  pair production via a non-universal massive neutral vector boson ($Z'$) are provided. 
For the chosen sets of couplings $Z'$ mass below 2 TeV using t-channel exchange diagrams and below 510 GeV 
for $ttj$ production at the LHC are excluded at 95\% CL. These CMS results exceed previous limits set by any 
other experiment.
