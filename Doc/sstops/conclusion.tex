\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, the first results on same sign top pair production using di-leptons have been presented. 
In the proton-proton collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$ at at $\sqrt{s} = 7 $ TeV, 
no significant deviations from the standard model expectations are observed. 
Limits on the cross sections for new physics involving $tt$ and $ttj$  pair production via a non-universal massive neutral vector boson ($Z'$) are presented. 
For the chosen sets of couplings, $Z'$ masses below 2 TeV using t-channel exchange diagrams and below 510 GeV 
for $ttj$ production at the LHC are excluded at 95\% CL. 
These results exceed previous limits set by any other experiment.
