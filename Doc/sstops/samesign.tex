\section{Search for Same Sign Top Quark Pair Production}
\label{sec:samesign}

This section summarizes the results of the search for same sign $tt$
pair production in the di-lepton channel. We use two data-driven methods 
to estimate background characterized by the presence of two isolated high $P_T$ same 
sign leptons, $\met$, and significant hadronic activity. For the purpose of this note we 
restrict ourselves to the $ee$, $e\mu$, and $\mu\mu$ final states, {\em i.e.}, we do not 
consider $\tau$'s, except in the case that the $\tau$ decays leptonically. 

As we will show in Section~\ref{sec:ssyields}, for this modified baseline selection is similar to
the published opposite sign di-lepton pair production cross section paper~\cite{topxsection}, where the main 
background is from SM \ttbar decays. The data-driven background prediction is based on a combination 
of estimating ``fake leptons''~\cite{fakenote} (FakeRate) and electrons reconstructed with the 
wrong sign~\cite{ssnote1} (Charge FlipRate). The probability for muons to be reconstructed with 
the wrong sign at the relevant momenta is negligible.

\subsection{Event Yields}
\label{sec:ssyields}

The observed and expected SM event yields in 35~pb$^{-1}$ after applying the event selections
described in Section~\ref{sec:eventselection} to the datasets described in Section~\ref{sec:datasamples} 
are detailed below. The final event yields also include the systematic uncertanities of
the method used.

\end{center}
\end{table}

The event yield has the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item We do not consider rare processes such as $qqW^\pm W^\pm, WWW, t\bar{t}W$, double parton $W^\pm W^\pm$, which are 
negligibly small~\cite{ssnote1}.
\item We found small contributions (0.01 events) from conversion of prompt photons in $W/Z\gamma$ using MC and are
not considered in order to avoid double counting in the single fake contributions.
\item The diboson backgrounds $WW, WZ, ZZ$ are taken from the MC as an additional background estimate. This contribution
is tabulated as the total MC driven predicition.
\item The prediction from fake rates includes the systematic error of 50\%. 
\item The flip rate prediction also includes an additional systematic error of 50\% based on statistics of the same
sign events observed in the control region~\cite{ssnote1}.
\item The systematic errors are added when propagating the fake/flip rates into total data-driven predictions.
\item All MC driven predictions also assume a flat 50\% systematic error.
\end{itemize}

The dominant SM contribution is from \ttbar decays. The total estimated background 
is obtained after the application of Fake and Charge Flip rates to the entire ensemble
of SM samples. The data yield is in good agreement with the predication from both MC as 
well as the data driven predictions. 

One of the key component of same sign top pair search is the fact that the final state mainly  
includes only one type of sign. For example, in the t-channel exchange: $ uu \rightarrow tt \rightarrow l^+ l^+ \mu \nu b b$
only +ve sign leptons are involved. As mentioned earlier, the quark quark, $\bar{u}\bar{u}$ scattering 
is highly suppressed due to the parton luminosities, thus we do not expect any significant contribution 
from -ve signed leptons. Given that the data driven methods are robust against any given choice of lepton 
charge~\cite{fakenote1}, we use half of the total background prediction for this search.

The results is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:sm_preditcion}.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hline
Same sign di-leptons & Event yield \\ \hline
Total Observed & 2 \\
Total Predicted & 0.9 $\pm$ 0.55 \\

\caption{ Observed and predicted number of events passing the event selection in 35 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. 
The uncertainty also includes systematic errors.\label{tab:sm_preditcion}}
\end{center}
\end{table}

%The ``anatomy'' of the 2 observed event is discussed in the appendix.
Although the observed events have two +ve di-leptons, we do not find this to be a significant deviation 
from the prediction.

\subsection{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:sssystematics}

Details of the systematic uncertainties studied are discussed elsewhere~\cite{ssnote1}. Here we summarize
the aspects important for the aforesaid signal.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:ssresults}

In absence of any significant deviation from the predicted background we set 95\% CL. on 
the number of observed events. Two statistical methods have been used for the upper limit. Both 
methods assume the errors on signal and background are un-correlated and use a log-normal
distribution for error pdfs. 

The first method used to compute the upper limit is based on Bayesian statistics~\cite{bayesian}.
A posterior probability $p(r)$ is used as a function of the signal strength $r = \sigma/\sigma_{SM}$ 
assuming a uniform prior for $r$ integrating the nuisance parameters associated to the uncertainties.
The upper limit at 95\% confidence level is then determined by integrating $p(r)$ to determine $r'$ which
satisfies $\int_{r'}^{\inf} p(r) dr = 0.05$.

We use the hybrid frequentist-bayesian $CLs$ approach~\cite{CLS} as the second method. Although the two 
statistical approaches are not equivalent, in this case we get similar results. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Upper limit at 95\% CL. with 12.5\% signal systematic error using Bayesian approach = 5.7  
\item Upper limit at 95\% CL. with 12.5\% signal systematic error using $CLs$ = 5.6  
\end{itemize}

We use 5.7 events as the upper limit for the rest of this document. This corresponds to a 95\% CL.  
upper limit on the effective cross section for new processes, including the effects of experimental
acceptance and efficiency, of 0.3 pb for the same sign di-lepton channel.

right-handed coupling, $f_R$. The solid lines represents regions due to t-channel exchange, where

scales, $\mu$ is set to the top mass. \label{fig:sstopexclusion}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:sstopexclusion} shows the exclusion region at 95\% CL. as a function of $Z'$ mass for 
various choices of the right-handed coupling, $f_R$. LO signal cross sections are used for this study. 
The limits on t-channel exchange diagrams $tt$ covers significant regions as a function of $Z'$ masses. 
In most cases it does not favor large values of the coupling $f_R$. As expected, when using 35 pb$^{-1}$ of luminosity 
the limits on $ttj$ production is weak and only excludes until $m_Z' \sim 510$ GeV for higher values of $f_R$.
