\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The CMS Collaboration recently published a search for new physics
in same-sign top production using events with same-sign isolated dileptons, jets, and \met~\cite{sstop}. 
In that study, as well as a closely related one~\cite{sspaper} the major
background is from \ttbar production, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbar}.

The dominant source of same-sign dileptons in \ttbar events are produced via, $t \rightarrow W b$; where 
one of the leptons is from $W \rightarrow \ell \nu $ and the other originates from semi-leptonic $b$ decays. 
We refer to the first as ``real lepton'' and the second as ``fake lepton''.
An additional requirement on the number of $b$ jets $\geq 2$, is expected to reduce this background significantly
as a b-quark can not produce an isolated lepton and at the same time provide a b-tag.

In this note we perform an inclusive signature based search for events with two isolated, same-sign leptons,
in association with at least 2 $b$ jets and \met. This generic signature should be sensitive to 
a wide variety of new physics scenarios leading to one or more same-sign top pairs in the final state, as well as the standard model
production of $t\bar{t}W$. In addition to the inclusive search, we thus perform several dedicated searches for a variety
of physics scenarios, including the standard model production of $t\bar{t}W$.
 
For the purpose of this note we restrict ourselves to the $ee$, $e\mu$, and $\mu\mu$ 
final states, {\em i.e.}, we do not consider $\tau$'s, except in the case that the $\tau$ decays leptonically.

This note is organized as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:searchbtag} we briefly outline the event selection used in this study 
along with event yields and background estimation for the inclusive search.
%
The description of systematics uncertanities on the 
acceptance is given in Section~\ref{sec:systematic}.  
%
In Section~\ref{sec:inclresults} we summarize the results 
of the inclusive search.
Section~\ref{sec:stampCollecting} then refines this search for the various physics scenarios considered, and
we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
