\section{Results - Additional Breakdown of Yields}
\label{sec:yields_projection}


{\bf The information in this appendix is not used quantitatively anywhere.}

The search regions used in this analysis and defined in Section~\ref{sec:regions} can be defined exclusively in either $\Ht$ or $\met$ as seen in the projection plots in Figure~\ref{fig:htmet}, where the search region breakdown in $\met$ was done as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Ht > 80~\GeV, 30 < \met < 50~\GeV$.
	\item $\Ht > 80~\GeV, 50 < \met < 120~\GeV$.	
	\item $\Ht > 80~\GeV, \met > 120~\GeV$.
\end{enumerate}	
	
and in $\Ht$ as
	
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $80 < \Ht < 200~\GeV, \met > 30~\GeV$.
	\item $200 < \Ht < 320~\GeV, \met > 30~\GeV$.
	\item $\Ht > 320~\GeV, \met > 30~\GeV$.
\end{enumerate}

In the following we report the breakdown of the expected and observed events
in the \Ht-\met\ SUSY search regions.
These are reported in Tables~\ref{tab:yield_ht80_200met30} to~\ref{tab:yield_ht80met120}.
The formatting of these tables is the same as in Section~\ref{sec:yields}.

\end{center}
\caption{\label{tab:yield_ht80_200met30}Observed event yields for 80 $< H_T < $ 200 GeV and \met $>$ 30 GeV
compared to expectations from simulation alone, and from the data-driven methods.
The {\em simulated backgrounds} contribution includes contributions from genuine  same-sign lepton
pairs (WZ, ZZ, leptons from same-sign W from single-parton, double-parton, and $t\bar{t}W$ production, etc.), 
as well as electrons from converted photons in $V\gamma$ production.
Entries with zero contributing events are reported with an uncertainty corresponding to one event.
This uncertainty is not added to the total MC contribution.
Systematic uncertainties (the second uncertainty if present)
 are displayed only for the final combined type of background, no systematic
uncertainty is added for estimates with zero entries.
Systematic uncertainties are 100\% correlated among the channels.
