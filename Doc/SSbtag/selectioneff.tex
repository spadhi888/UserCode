\section{Selection Efficiency}
\label{sec:seleff}
%We would like to quote our results as a cross section, or cross section limit, that is as
%model independent as possible. 
%What we mean by this is that we carefully define the acceptance, and provide enough
%details about the selection efficiency within that acceptance that anybody can use their favorite Monte Carlo
%generator of new physics, define an acceptance at the hard scatter level (status = 3 in Pythia), and correctly estimate
%the efficiency for this new physics model to within 50\% or so.
%
%In the present section we provide the necessary {\em correction factors} that one needs to estimate the efficiency.
%There are three effects. 
%First, our lepton selection efficiencies vary significantly as a function of both $\pt$ and $|\eta |$,
%especially for electrons. 
%Second, both \met and $\Ht$ have {\em turn-on} curves due to finite resolution effects.
%Third, there is a potentialy significant $\pt$ dependent data/Monte Carlo scale factor that we obtain from 
%Z to dilepton events using  the tag \& probe technique.\footnote{The results of the tag \& probe measurements
%using current data and simulation suggest the difference is small and no data/MC scale factor is applied.}
%Even though the scale factors are described last, we include them in the lepton efficiency parameterization presented below
%in Section~\ref{sec:lepeff}.
%
%
%\subsection{Definition of Acceptance}
%\label{sec:acceptance}
%
%Lepton acceptance is defined for both leptons with $|\eta|<2.4$
%and with momenta either $\pt>10~\GeV$\ ($5~\GeV$) for electrons (muons) and the {\em low-\pt} dilepton selections,
%or with one lepton with $\pt > 10$\ GeV and the other with $\pt > 20$\ GeV for the {\em high-\pt} selections
%described in Section~\ref{sec:eventSel}.
%$\Ht^{\rm gen}$\ is comprised of the sum $\pt$ of all colored particles at the hard scatter level that have $\pt > 40$ GeV
%and $|\eta |<2.5$. 
%$\met^{\rm~gen}$ is defined as the absolute value of the vector sum of the transverse 
%momentum of all non-interacting particles, e.g. neutrinos and LSP.
%
%
%\subsection{Lepton Efficiencies}
%\label{sec:lepeff}
%
%These curves are to be taken directly from simulation, they are primarily relevant
%for the outside-CMS theorists to be able to use our results.
%A similar set of curves has been provided in~\cite{ref:sus10004}.
%Lepton selection efficiencies, including the MC-to-data scale factors,
%are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:lepeffLM6}.

%\end{figure}
%
%The efficiency dependence can be parameterzied as a function of \pt\ as 
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\epsilon = \epsilon_{\rm \infty} {\rm erf}\left ( \frac{\pt - C}{\sigma} \right)
%	+ \epsilon_C \left( 1.- {\rm erf}\left ( \frac{\pt - C}{\sigma} \right) \right),
%\label{eq:lepeffFitF}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\epsilon_{\rm \infty}$ gives the value of efficiency plateau at high momenta,
%$C$ is equal to 5 (10) for muons (electrons),
%$\epsilon_C$ gives the value of the efficiency at $\pt=C$,
%and $\sigma$ describes how fast the transition region is.
%The results of the fit for electrons and muons are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:lepeffLM6fit}.

%\subsection{MET and $\Ht$ efficiency turn-on}
%\label{sec:turnon}
%Our selections on reconstructed jets begin with a requirement of at least two jets with $\pt>40~\GeV$.
%Two such jets are present in approximately 95\% of the events in LM1 and LM6 with $\Ht^{\rm gen}>200~\GeV$ prior
%to any additional requirement on colored partons at the generator level beyond the sum of \pt.
%This represents the fraction of acceptance to two jets.
%In the following we proceed with determining $\Ht$ amd \met\ requirement with respect to 
%events that have generator-level requirements on the leptons and colored particles as described in Section~\ref{sec:acceptance}.
%
%The efficiency for an event to pass a given reconstructed \met\ ($\Ht$) threshold is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:htmetThresh}
%as a function of $\met^{\rm~gen}$ ($\Ht^{\rm gen}$) in events passing $\Ht^{\rm gen}>200~\GeV$ ($\met^{\rm~gen}>30~\GeV$).
%Due to rather small fraction of events in LM6 simulation having low \Ht\ activity, the \Ht\ curves are made with LM1.
%Results of the fits of these curves to $0.5 \epsilon_{\infty} \{{\rm erf}[(x - x_{1/2})/\sigma] + 1\}$ are summarized
%in Table~\ref{tab:htmetThresh}.
%Neither the \met\ nor \Ht\ curves show a significant bias in the position of the point with half the plateau efficiency ($x_{1/2}$).
%The inefficiency at the plateau is essentially negligible.
%The width of the threshold $\sigma$ increases with the value of the cut.

\subsection{Data - Monte Carlo Scale Factor}
\label{sec:tnp}

The efficiencies of the lepton isolation and identification requirements (including all quality requirements) 
are measured with the tag\&probe method in dilepton Z events using the full 2011 dataset.
The efficiency of the identification requirements is a property of the lepton itself and is directly applicable
 to the leptons in signal events.
The efficiency of the isolation requirement, however, is a strong function of all other (mainly hadronic)
activity in the event.
The following results are based on measurements using the full dataset and compared 
to simulation that is re-weighed to have a pile-up distribution comparable to that observed in data.

The electron selection efficiencies are measured in events passing 
the \verb=Ele17..._SC8_Mass30= and \\\verb=Ele17.._Ele8_Mass30= triggers,
which require one well-identified electron and one super-cluster or GSF electron with $\pt>8~\GeV$ forming a pair with a mass
above 30~\GeVcc.  
For higher $\pt$ electrons, the \verb=Ele32...SC_17= triggers are also used, 
which require one well identified electron and one super-cluster with $\pt >17~\GeV$.
In the tag\&probe analysis the electron tag is required to match to the well-identified electron 
from the trigger and also to pass all the electron requirements described in~\cite{ssnote2011}.
The probe electron is required to have
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pt>20~\GeV$, $|\eta|<2.4$, excluding the superclusters with $1.4442<|\eta|<1.566$.
\end{itemize}
The isolation efficiency is measured with the probes passing all electron selections , except for the 
trigger requirement and the isolation itself.
The identification efficiency is measured with probes passing the isolation requirement.
Results of the measurement are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:eleEffs}.
The contribution from the Z events is based on simple counting in the mass range of 86--96~\GeVc,
the MC contribution includes Wjet events to match the expected residual backgrounds in this mass window.
The following sources of systematic uncertainty are attributed to this measurement:
background contribution, selection of dielectron events, factorization of the isolation and ID parts.
The size of the background contribution can be estimated using MC alone
and also  tested in data with  the same-sign dielectron
events, which should represent the number of backgrounds reasonably well.
The effect of backgrounds on the measured efficiency is established to be approximately 
2\% for the combined identification
and isolation selection efficiency.
The narrow mass window used to count electron pairs introduces a bias of about 3\% 
to the measured efficiency
by rejecting failing probes that happen to have a worse resolution or a shift
in the measured momentum.
This bias is expected to approximately cancel in data and simulation.
We include a half of the 3\% as a source of systematics.
Based on simulation alone, the combined selection efficiency, measured with respect to the probe electron,
differs from the product of the components by approximately 1\% or less depending on the momentum range.
All of these effects combined give a systematic uncertainty on the total data-to-MC scale factor
in the lepton selection efficiencies of 2.5\% for $\pt>20~\GeV$.

The muon selection efficiencies are measured using events passing the double-muon trigger.
The tag muon is required to pass all of the muon selection requirements described in~\cite{ssnote2011}.
The probe muon is required to pass
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pt>20~\GeVc$;
\item $|\eta|<2.4$;
\item have both the global and the tracker muon types.
\end{itemize}
Both the  isolation and the identification efficiency are measured using probes failing only the requirement in question,
assuming the efficiencies factorize.
Results of the muon identification and isolation efficiency measurements are presented in Table~\ref{tab:muEffs}.
As expected, the identification efficiency for muons measured in data and in MC agree well,
while there is some discrepancy for the isolation efficiency.
Similar sources of systematic uncertainty are considered here as those considered for electrons.
Most of the reconstructed (probe) muons are real muons and the measurement of the identification efficiency
is not affected significantly by backgrounds.
With the tighter mass window used here to select events,
 the backgrounds are estimated to be small.
This narrow mass window, however, introduces a bias of about 1.5\% 
to the measured efficiency
by rejecting failing probes that happen to have a worse resolution or a shift
in the measured momentum.
This bias is expected to approximately cancel in data and simulation.
We include a half of the 1.5\% as a source of systematics.
We assign a systematic uncertainty of 1\% on the identification and isolation efficiency measurement  
from a comparison between the simple counting of Z events and fitting the mass shape to a gaussian signal and an 
exponential background component.
Based on studies in MC events, we find that the isolation and the identification efficiencies
 factorize near-perfectly and do not assign any additional systematic uncertainty.
The total systematic uncertainty on the muon efficiency measurement in 
data, simply covering the full momentum range, is 2\%.

The tag\&probe results in Tables~\ref{tab:eleEffs} and~\ref{tab:muEffs} show for both electrons
and muons the ID part of the selection is reproduced well by simulation.
The isolation efficiency in data is measured lower than in simulation with a scale factor still fairly close to 1.
As discussed in~\cite{ssnote2011} we assign a systematic uncertainty of 5\% 
due to modeling of the isolation efficiency for signal events.
This uncertainty is expected to cover the remaining discrepancy in the isolation efficiency measured
using the tag\&probe method.
Using these arguments we choose to not apply the data-to-simulation scale factors.
