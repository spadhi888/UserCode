\section{Results - Exclusive Yields}
\label{sec:yields_exclusive}


{\bf The information in this appendix is not used 
quantitatively anywhere.}



The tighter \Ht\ and \met\ search regions used for the SUSY production scenarios
and defined in Section~\ref{sec:regions} can be defined exclusively and cover the same
phase space without an overlap between regions:
\begin{enumerate}
     \item Exclusive low-\Ht\ low-\met\ region: $200< \Ht < 320~\GeV, 50 < \met < 120~\GeV$.
     \item Exclusive low-\Ht\ high-\met\ region: $200 < \Ht < 320~\GeV, \met>120~\GeV$.
     \item Exclusive high-\Ht\ low-\met\ region: $\Ht>320~\GeV, 50 < \met < 120~\GeV$.
     \item Exclusive high-\Ht\ high-\met\ region: $\Ht>320~\GeV, \met>120~\GeV$.
\end{enumerate}
The exclusive high-\Ht\ high-\met\ region is the same as its inclusive version.

In the following we report exclusive breakdown of the expected and observed events
in the \Ht-\met\ SUSY search regions.
These are reported in Tables~\ref{tab:yield_excl_ht200met120} to~\ref{tab:yield_excl_ht320met50}.
The formatting of these tables is the same as in Section~\ref{sec:yields}.
Results for the exclusive high-\Ht\ high-\met\ region are not repeated and can be found in Table~\ref{tab:yield_ht320met120}.

\caption{\label{tab:yield_excl_ht200met120}Observed event yields in the exclusive low-\Ht\ high-\met\ region
($200< \Ht < $ 320 GeV, \met $>$ 120 GeV)
compared to expectations from simulation alone, and from the data-driven methods.
The upper part of the table is based on simulation only and is used only as a reference.
The lower part is the main result of the analysis.
The SF (DF) contributions are for events with one (two) fake leptons.
The {\em MC Pred} contribution includes contributions from genuine  same-sign lepton
pairs (a sum of the rows from $V\gamma$ down to $ZZZ$).
Entries with zero contributing events are reported with an uncertainty corresponding to one event.
This uncertainty is not added to the total MC contribution.
Systematic uncertainties (the second uncertainty if present)
 are displayed only for the final combined type of background, no systematic
uncertainty is added for estimates with zero entries.
Systematic uncertainties are 100\% correlated among the channels.
