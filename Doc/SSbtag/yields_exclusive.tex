\section{Results - Exclusive Yields}
\label{sec:yields_exclusive}


In the following we report yields of events observed in data and compare them to the predictions
from the data-driven methods as well as from simulation.
These results are reported for {\em high-\pt} and {\em low-\pt} dilepton selections
with \Ht\ and \met\ selected as defined in the baseline selection described in Section~\ref{sec:eventSel},
as well as for the signal regions defined in Section~\ref{sec:sigregion}.
As anticipated, the MC predicts that $t\bar{t}$ is the largest background in all cases.
The data yield is in good agreement with the prediction from both MC as well as the data driven prediction.
The procedure for arriving at these data driven predictions is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:datadriven}.
These data-driven predictions supersede all the MC estimates of the contributions
from events with fake leptons or with leptons with misreconstructed charge.
The remaining MC contribution in the final estimates of background events are those with real leptons:
$WZ\to lll\nu$, $ZZ\to llll$; same-sign W from single-parton (sp$WW$), double-parton (dp$WW$), and $t\bar{t}W$ production.
%%We ignore contributions from the rare SM processes with genuine same-sign lepton pairs,
%%such as the same-sign W production and \ttbar+W.
%%Cross sections for these rare processes are given in Table~\ref{tab:MCDsets}.
Note that we have also included a  contribution from W/Z+$\gamma$ background events
where the asymmetric conversion of the photon can give rise to an electron of the same sign as a lepton from W or Z.
This background is not predicted by the fake lepton prediction method.
%%Based on the estimates of the 2010 data analysis, we expect less than 0.3 events passing the nominal selections
%%in 1~\fbin\ data sample, which is substantially smaller than other backgrounds.
Results of background estimates in simulation and data are compared with the number of observed events in data 
in the tables below.
The SUSY LM2 point yield based on the LO cross section is provided as a reference.
The NLO/LO k-factor for LM2 is 1.33~\cite{ref:susyMCtwiki}.
