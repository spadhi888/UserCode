\section{Outreach}
\label{sec:outreach}
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:seleff}, we want to provide 
enough information so that anybody can use their favorite Monte Carlo
generator of new physics, define an acceptance at the hard 
scatter level (status = 3 in Pythia), and correctly estimate
the efficiency for this new physics model to within 50\% or so.

The relevant information on selection efficiencies is 
given in Section~\ref{sec:seleff}.  In this Section we give the 
missing ingredients for this program, namely the 
95\% upper limits on the number of events for the various 
signal regions.  We also show how well our efficiency model 
works in a few cases.

\subsection{Limits on number of events}
\label{sec:outreachlimits}
Here we should give the limits on the number of events for the various 
signal region definitions.  This is always a little tricky because
we always debate what uncertainties to include.  I guess we 
came up with a receipe in the generic analysis (both 2010 and
2011), but I don't remember what waht we did.  In any case, we should 
do the same here and describe it.  It should take $<$ 1 hour.
What we want is a Table with concise signal region definition, 
number of observed events, total BG, and UL on new physics contribution
expressed in number of events.

\subsection{Testing the efficiency model}
\label{sec:outreachtest}
We should take two or three model-points and compare the efficiency times
acceptance for the simulation and the efficiency model.  This is 
a little bit of work (maybe one day's worth?)
