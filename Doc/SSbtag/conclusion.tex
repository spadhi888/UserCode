\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, the first search using same-sign dileptons with $b$-jets and \met has been presented. In the
proton-proton collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 349 pb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV,
no significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed. We use this data to set 95\% CL. on the
number of observed events.
