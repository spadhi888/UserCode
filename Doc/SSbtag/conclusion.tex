\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, the first search using same-sign dileptons with $b$-jets and \met~~has 
been presented. In the
proton-proton collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 
 4.7 fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV,
no significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed. 
We use this data to set 95\% CL. on the
number of observed events.
We set limits on the parameter space of six new physics models:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A model with a $Z'$ vector boson with flavor violating couplings to $u-$ and $t$-quarks.

\item A model with a neutral scalar with flavor violating couplings to $u-$ and $t$-quarks.

\item A SUSY model of stop production from two body gluino decays: 
$pp \to \widetilde{g} \widetilde{g}$ followed by
$\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$ and $\widetilde{t} \to t \chi_1^0$.

\item A SUSY model of stop pair production from three body gluino decays:
$pp \to \widetilde{g} \widetilde{g}$ followed by
$\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}\chi_1^0$.

\item A SUSY model of sbottom pair production: $pp \to \tilde{b}\tilde{b}$ followed
by $\tilde{b} \to t\chi^{-}$ and $\chi^{-} \to W^- \chi_1^0$.

\item A SUSY model of sbottom production from gluino decays:
$pp \to \widetilde{g} \widetilde{g}$ followed by
$\widetilde{g} \to \widetilde{b}\bar{b}$,
$\widetilde{b} \to t\chi^-$, and $\chi^{-} \to W^- \chi_1^0$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Finally, we provide enough experimental information to allow interested
phenomenologists to use our data to confront additional new physics models in 
an approximate way.
