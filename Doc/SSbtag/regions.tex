\section{Search Regions}
\label{sec:regions}

The count of events passing the baseline selections can 
be used to test the background predictions with the best available
stastistical precision as this is the largest sample.
We increase the sensitivity of this analysis to the models selected in 
Section~\ref{sec:intro} by considering events passing the following
search region selections applied on top of the baseline selections.

\begin{itemize}
  \item ++ region, including only positively charged lepton pairs 
    for same-sign top production via $Z^\prime$ or in MaxFV. 
    This selection reduces the fake-lepton and charge misidentification backgrounds,
    while keeping essentially all the signal, which is produced primarily from the $uu$ initial state,
    due to the available PDF luminosities.
  \item The following tighther \Ht\ and \met\ regions are defined to search for the SUSY
    production scenarios. 
    As mentioned above, all of them have four b quarks, up to two hadronically decaying W bosons,
    and at least two neutrinos and two LSPs to make up for \Ht\ and \met,
    varying between the model points.
    A region with the best expected limit is to be used in every particular case.
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item Low-\Ht\ low-\met region: $\Ht>200~\GeV, \met>50~\GeV$.
     \item Low-\Ht\ high-\met region: $\Ht>200~\GeV, \met>120~\GeV$.
     \item High-\Ht\ low-\met region: $\Ht>320~\GeV, \met>50~\GeV$.
     \item High-\Ht\ high-\met region: $\Ht>320~\GeV, \met>120~\GeV$.
     \item Low-\Ht\ low-\met region: $\Ht>200~\GeV, \met>50~\GeV$ with 
$\geq 3$ btags (all other regions have $\geq 2$ btags).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
