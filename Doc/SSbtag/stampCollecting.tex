\section{Searches for Specific Models}
\label{sec:stampCollecting}

Our signature, two isolated same-sign leptons plus, at least two b-tagged jets, and \met, 
is common to many different new physics scenarios.
Here we refine our analysis to define dedicated signal regions for a few of these scenarios,
and provide 95\% C.L. upper limits on their respective model parameter space.


\subsection{Same sign top production due a $Z'$}
\label{sec:sstops}

This is an extension of the 2010 CMS published CMS analysis\cite{sstop}.
The main difference is that here in order to improve the signal-to-noise
we require two b-tagged jets.  This would not have made sense in 2010, since 
at the time the integrated luminosity was low enough that the analysis was almost
background free without requiring b-tags.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Discussion, $Z'$ model}

Recent measurements of the inclusive forward-backward $t\bar{t}$ production 
asymmetry ($A_{FB}$) from the 
Tevatron experiments show deviations from the standard model 
(SM) expectations~\cite{d0:fwtop, cdf:fwtop1, cdf:fwtop2}.
% The largest (3$\sigma$) deviation~\cite{cdf:fwtop2} is found 
% to be in the region of high invariant mass with $M_{t\bar{t}} >  450$ GeV. 
Several attempts have been made to explain this asymmetry~\cite{berger, Buckley, Gresham, zoltan}. 
One of the most natural ways to induce such an asymmetry would be through
Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in the top quark sector. 
The forward-backward asymmetry in $u\bar{u} \to t\bar{t}$ would then be generated
by t-channel exchange of a new massive $Z'$ boson that couples chirally to
$u$ and $t$ at the same vertex, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbar}~\cite{berger}.
The same type of interaction would also give rise to same-sign top pair production, 
as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:tchannel} and Fig.~\ref{fig:schannel}. 
In this case, the initial state involves two $u-$quarks and 
thus the cross section at the LHC is enhanced due 
to the large valence quark parton density of the proton.

\label{fig:schannel}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


We consider the model of Reference~\cite{berger}.  
The relevant $u-t-Z'$ interaction term in the Lagrangian is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:L_berger}
  \mathcal{L} = g_W \bar{u} \gamma^\mu (f_L P_L + f_R P_R)tZ'_\mu + h.c
\end{equation}

where $g_W$ is the weak coupling strength. The left-handed coupling is set to $f_L = 0$, due 
to the $B_d-\bar{B_d}$ mixing constraint~\cite{Cao}. 
The right-handed coupling $f_R$ and the $Z'$ mass are free parameters in the model.
Within this model there is a narrow range of parameter space
consistent with the TeVatron measurements of $\sigma(p\bar{p} \to t\bar{t})$ 
and $A_{FB}$, which is not excluded by direct searches for same sign tops.
This region is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:berger_limit}.

% Fig.~\ref{fig:tchannel} shows the t-channel exchange diagrams that can lead to the same-sign $tt$ final state. 
% As expected the coupling appears twice in the Feynman diagrams, thus the predicated rate is proportional to $f_R^4$. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{\protect From Reference~\cite{berger}; the shaded area covers the parameter
space consistent with the $A_{FB}$ and $\sigma(t\bar{t})$ from the Tevatron;

from same sign top searches at the Tevatron; the remaining lines represent the
expectations of Reference~\cite{berger}
for LHC searches in 1 fb$^{-1}$. \label{fig:berger_limit}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Monte Carlo events for this model were generated using Madgraph in the same way as 
for the 2010 analysis (see Reference~\cite{ttAN}).



\subsubsection{Signal region definition for same sign top from $Z'$}
\label{sec:sstopsigdefinition}
In this study we search for same-sign dileptons originating from $tt$ 
or $ttj$ pair production as described above.  At the LHC $uu \to tt$ 
dominates over $\bar{u}\bar{u} \to \bar{t}\bar{t}$, thus we concentrate
on same-sign positive leptons.  The \met~~and $H_T$ cuts are typical 
of a dilepton top analysis: two or more jets of $P_T>40$ GeV, 
$\met > 30$ GeV and $H_T > 80$ GeV.  This corresponds to Table~\ref{tab:yieldBase_pp}:
5 events observed and 4.42 $\pm$ 0.80 $\pm$ 1.39 expected from background.

\subsubsection{Limits on the $Z'$ model}
\label{sec:sstopslimits}
Using the results from Section~\ref{sec:sstopsigdefinition}, we set 
a limit at 95\% CL of 7.2 events using the CL$_{\rm S}$ method.
The expected limit is 6.4 events.
% $7.8^{+3.6}_{-3.1}$ events.
In the MC we find $Acc \times Eff \times BR = 0.00233$, independent of $Z'$ mass. 
This results in an upper limit on the cross-section of 0.67 pb.
The limit includes uncertainty
on JES (12\%), btagging (10\%), lepton efficiencies (11\%), luminosity (4.5\%),
and PDF (3\%).

The cross-section limit is turned into an exclusion limit in the $m(Z')$ vs $f_R$
plane using the LO calculation of the $pp \to tt$ cross-section in this model.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sstopexclusion}, together with the corresponding
plot from the 2010 analysis.


For $M_{Z'} >> M_{\rm top}$ the Lagrangian of equation 1 is 
equivalent to 
$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{C_{RR}}{\Lambda^2}
 [\bar{u} \gamma^\mu t][\bar{u} \gamma_{\mu} t] + h.c.$~\cite{cdfth2},
with $\frac{C_{RR}}{\Lambda^2} = \frac{2 g_W^2 f_R^2}{M_{Z'}^2}$.
 Our limit on $f_R$, calculated for $M_{Z'}=2$ TeV, 
would then correspond to $\frac{C_{RR}}{\Lambda^2} < 0.6$ TeV$^{-2}$ at 
95\% confidence.  This is more stringent than the limit recently reported
by CDF: $\frac{C_{RR}}{\Lambda^2} < 3.7$ TeV$^{-2}$~\cite{cdflimit}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{What is still missing for the $Z'$ model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rescale everything to take into account that the leptonic BR in MG is not quite right
\item Signal Contamination effects (should be tiny)
\item Double check calculation of $\frac{C_{RR}}{\Lambda^2}$
\item Prettify the exclusion plot.

\subsection{Maximally Flavor Violation Model (MXFV)}
\label{sec:mxfv}

\subsubsection{Theoretical discussion of MXFV}
\label{sec:mxfvtheory}

This is a model~\cite{mxflv1,mxflv2,mxflv3} with a new scalar 
SU(2) doublet field $\Phi_{FV} = (\eta^0,\eta^+)$ that couples the first and third 
generation quarks ($q_1,q_3$) via a Lagrangian term 
$\mathcal{L}_{FV} = \xi_{13} \Phi_{FV} q_1 q_3$.  Remarkably, it appears that this
model is largely consistent with constraints from flavor physics.

The model results in same sign top pairs in the final state as foolows
\begin{itemize}

\item Single $\eta^0$ production: $ug \to t\eta^0 \to tt\bar{u}, t\bar{t}u$

\item $\eta^0$ pair production: $u \bar{u} \to \eta^0 \eta^0 \to tt\bar{u}\bar{u},
uu\bar{t}\bar{t}, t\bar{t}u\bar{u}$

\item $\eta^0$ $t$-channel exchange: $uu \to tt$, $\bar{u}\bar{u} \to \bar{t}\bar{t}$
\end{itemize}

Monte Carlo events were generated using LHE files\cite{simplifiedModel} interfaced 
with Madgraph.  Madgraph was used to decay the top quarks in order to preserve 
spin-correlations.  The cross-sections at LO for same sign $tt$ pairs for the three
processes in the MXFV model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mxvxsec}.  The $t$-channel
process is the most important.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figs/mxvxsec.pdf}
\caption{Cross section at LO for the $tt$ final state in the three MXFV modes
as a function of $\eta^0$ mass for $\xi = 1$.
\label{fig:mxvxsec}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Signal region definition for the MXFV model}
\label{sec:mxfvdefinition}
The properties of the final state in this model are basically the same as in the $Z'$ model.
Thus, we use the same signal region definition (see Section \ref{sec:sstopsigdefinition}).


\subsubsection{Limits for the MXFV model}
\label{sec:mxfvlimits}
Our limits in the $\xi$-M($\eta^0$) plane are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MxVExcl}.
They are calculated using the LO cross-section for this model.

\caption{Limits in the $\xi$-Mass($\chi^0$) plane.  Left: CMS.  Right: CDF

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{What is still missing for the MXFV model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need to include the $tt\bar{u}$ final state
\item Rescale everything to take into account that the leptonic BR in MG is not quite right
\item Signal Contamination effects (should be tiny)
\item Prettify the exclusion plot, put CDF on same plot perhaps
\end{itemize}



\subsection{$\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$ Model}
\label{sec:firststopmodel}

\subsubsection{Theoretical discussion of the $\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$ Model}
\label{sec:firststopmodeltheory}

This is an interesting model for stop pair production through gluino 
decays\cite{susyssbtags}\cite{susyssbtags2}\cite{wacker}\cite{naturalness4}.
It is a ``realistic'' and well-motivated 
model in the sense that it applies to the situation 
where all the squarks except the stop are very heavy.  A ``light'' stop is of course
generally favored in SUSY, and LHC results are pointing to ``heavy'' superpartners.
Then if the stop
is light enough the gluino would decay with 100\% BR as $\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$
and then the stop would decay as $\widetilde{t} \to t \chi_1^0$, if kinematically 
accessible.
The parameters of the model are $M(\widetilde{g})$, $M(\widetilde{t})$, $M(\chi_1^0)$.

The final state after gluino pair production is then $tt\bar{t}\bar{t}\chi_1^0\chi_1^0$.
It is the same final state as the {\tt T1ttt} {\bf (need a reference here)}
simplified model, except that 
it proceeds through an intermediate stop.  This final state is rich in leptons,
and has four b-quarks.  The same sign dilepton $+$ btags $+$ 
\met~~signature is a 
particularly good way to go after it.


\subsubsection{Signal region definition for the $\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$ Model}
\label{sec:firststopdefinition}
For each point in parameter space we will use the signal region that gives
the best expected limit.

\subsubsection{Limits for the $\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$ Model}
\label{sec:firststoplimits}
Nothing yet.  The money plot will be an exclusion in the 2D plot of 
stop mass vs gluino mass for a few LSP masses.

\subsubsection{What is missing for the $\widetilde{g} \to t\widetilde{t}$ Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Everything in Sections~\ref{sec:firststopdefinition} and \ref{sec:firststoplimits}
\item Perhaps more details on the MC signal generation
\item Need a reference for the {\tt T1tttt} model
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt T1tttt} Model}
\label{t1ttmodel}

\subsubsection{Theoretical discussion of the {\tt T1tttt} Model}
\label{sec:t1tttheory}
The {\tt T1tttt} {\bf (need a reference)} simplified model is very similar to the model of 
Section~\ref{sec:firststopmodel}.  In this model it is assumed that all squarks 
are very heavy, but the stop is somewhat lighter than the other 
quarks\cite{stopVirtual}\cite{stopVirtualPRD}.
Then the gluino would decay as $\widetilde{g} \to t\bar{t}\chi_1^0$ through virtual stops.
Other gluino decay modes would be suppressed because the stop is the lightest squark.
The final state after gluino pair production is $tt\bar{t}\bar{t}\chi_1^0\chi_1^0$,
just as in Section~\ref{sec:firststopmodel}.
The model parameters are $M(\widetilde{g})$ and $M(\chi_1^0)$.



\subsubsection{Signal region definition for the {\tt T1tttt} Model}
\label{sec:t1ttttdefinition}
For each point in parameter space we will use the signal region that gives

\begin{itemize}
\item Everything in Sections~\ref{sec:t1ttttdefinition} and \ref{sec:t1ttttlimits}
\item Need a reference for the {\tt T1tttt} model
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Sbottom pair production Model}
\label{sec:sbottompair}
In this model we have $pp \to \tilde{b}\tilde{b}$.  The sbottom decays 
as $\tilde{b} \to t\chi^{-}$ followed by $\chi^{-} \to W^- \chi_1^0$. 
The final state is $t\bar{t}W^+W^- \chi_1^0 \chi_1^0$. 
The model parameters are $M(\widetilde{b})$, $M(\chi_1^0)$, and $M(\chi^{\pm})$.
For simplicity we only consider mass parameters such that the $\chi^{-}$ is on shell.

\subsubsection{Signal region definition for the sbottom pair production model}
\label{sec:sbottompairdefinition}
For each point in parameter space we will use the signal region that gives
the best expected limit.

\subsubsection{Limits for the sbottom pair production model}
\label{sec:sbottompairlimits}
Nothing yet.  The money plot will be exclusion lines in the
2D plot of sbottom mass vs. LSP mass for a few choices of the $\chi^{\pm}$ mass.

\subsubsection{What is missing for the sbottom pair production model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Everything in Sections~\ref{sec:sbottompairdefinition} and \ref{sec:sbottompairlimits}
\item It would be nice to have a reference.  I am not sure that the references that
we have on our twiki are appropriate. 
\item Perhaps more details on the MC signal generation
\end{itemize}


\subsection{$\widetilde{g} \to \widetilde{b}\bar{b}$ Model}
\label{sec:gbb}
This model is mostly gluino pair production followed by 
$\widetilde{g} \to \widetilde{b}\bar{b}$, $\widetilde{b} \to t \chi^{-}$ and
$\chi^{-} \to W^- \chi_1^0$. 
The final state is $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}W^+W^- \chi_1^0 \chi_1^0$
or $ttb\bar{b}W^+W^- \chi_1^0 \chi_1^0$ $(+ c.c.)$.
The model also includes the $b g \to \widetilde{b} \widetilde{g}$ process,
in which case the final state is
$tb\bar{b}W^+W^- \chi_1^0 \chi_1^0$ $(+ c.c.)$. {\bf However: I don't 
think that any of the PDFs that we use is a 5-flavor PDF that 
includes $b$-quarks, so this may never happen.  To be chacked.}
The model parameters are $M(\widetilde{g})$
$M(\widetilde{b})$, $M(\chi_1^0)$, and $M(\chi^{\pm})$.
For simplicity we only consider mass parameters such that the $\chi^{-}$ is on shell.

\subsubsection{Signal region definition for the $\widetilde{g} \to \widetilde{b}\bar{b}$ Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item Everything in Sections~\ref{sec:gbbdefinition} and \ref{sec:gbblimits}

references that
we have on our twiki are appropriate. 
\item Perhaps more details on the MC signal generation
