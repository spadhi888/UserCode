\section{Searches for Specific Models}
\label{sec:stampCollecting}

Our signature, two isolated same-sign leptons plus, at least two b-tagged jets, and \met, 
is common to many different new physics scenarios, as well as standard model $t\bar{t}W$ production.

Here we refine our analysis to define dedicated signal regions for a few of these scenarios,
and provide 95\% C.L. upper limits on their respective model parameter space.

{\it We expect to explore the following models for the final paper:}

\begin{itemize}
\item SUSY gluino pair production with the gluino decaying to top and stop as suggested in~\cite{susyssbtags}.
\item Top pair production as proposed by~\cite{berger} and searched for by CMS with 2010 data~\cite{sstop}.
\item $T_{5/3}$ fermion from Little Higgs models as suggested in~\cite{littlehiggs}.
\item A simplified model for same-sing top pair production as suggested in~\cite{simplifiedModel}.
\item Standard model $t\bar{t}W$ production.
\end{itemize}

{\it We will fill this in as we generate the samples, and figure out what minor changes to our baseline cuts each model
requires to be sort of moderately optimized. In general, we expect changes in lepton $p_T$, \met, $H_T$, and possibly
jet $p_T$ requirements, but no object selection changes.}
