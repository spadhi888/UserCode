\section{Searches for Specific Models}
\label{sec:stampCollecting}

Our signature, two isolated same-sign leptons plus, at least two b-tagged jets, and \met, 
is common to many different new physics scenarios, as well as standard model $t\bar{t}W$ production.

Here we refine our analysis to define dedicated signal regions for a few of these scenarios,
and provide 95\% C.L. upper limits on their respective model parameter space.

{\it We expect to explore the following models for the final paper:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Top pair production via t-channel $Z^\prime$ exchange
as proposed by~\cite{berger} and searched for by CMS with 2010 data~\cite{sstop}. This is in some ways a minimal 
model for our purposes, as it produces nothing other than same sign dileptons, two b-jets, and moderate \met\ typical
for two leptonic W decays.
\item A simplified model for same-sing top pair production as suggested in~\cite{simplifiedModel}. 
The production mechanisms here range from t-channel uu-scattering to $tt$, as in the previous example, to
$tt\bar{u}\bar{u}$. The main difference to the previous model is different kinematics of the top quarks
due to an intermeditate resonance $\eta^0\to t \bar{u}$ decay. The mass of the $\eta^0$ is the main parameter
in the simplified model.
\item Standard model $t\bar{t}W$ production. Here the final state is same sign dileptons, two neutrinos, 
i.e. moderate \met, plus one top quark that decays generically.
\item $T_{5/3}$ fermion from Little Higgs models as suggested in~\cite{littlehiggs} lead to a $t\bar{t}W^+W^-$ final state, thus providing one additional W over the previous example.
\item SUSY gluino pair production with the gluino decaying to top and stop as suggested in~\cite{susyssbtags}\cite{susyssbtags2}. Depending on stop mass, this leads to a final state of either 
$t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ plus \met , or $tt\bar{Q}\bar{Q}$ 
plus \met\ with $Q$ being charm or beauty, and charge conjugates, as sources for the same sign dilepton plus 
two btags plus \met. Independent of stop mass, final states with same sign dileptons plus four heavy flavor quarks
plus \met\ are produced.
\end{itemize}

{\it We will fill this in as we generate the samples, and figure out what minor changes to our baseline cuts each model
requires to be sort of moderately optimized. In general, we expect changes in lepton $p_T$, \met, $H_T$, and possibly
jet $p_T$ requirements, but no object selection changes.}
