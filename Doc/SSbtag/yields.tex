\section{Event Yields and Background Estimation}
\label{sec:yields}

In the following Tables~\ref{tab:yield_baselinenomet} 
to~\ref{tab:yield_ht320nomet}
we summarize the background 
estimates and compare them to the
observed counts of events in data for the baseline and search region selections
defined in Sections~\ref{sec:eventsel} and~\ref{sec:regions}.
In each table the expectations from the simulation alone are given 
in the upper part.
 These are used to get a feeling of the expected contributions.
Among these MC expectations, 
only those with actual final state 
isolated same-sign leptons are used for the final result
as described in Section~\ref{sec:bkgds}.
The lower part of each table is the main result of the analysis
used for comparisons with data and setting constraints on various models.
These include the predictions for the fake-lepton and charge misidentification
backgrounds derived as described in Section~\ref{sec:datadriven}.

To reiterate and make it absolutely clear.  The total background
prediction in a given signal region
is the sum of three distinct components:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The data-driven charge misidentification prediction (row ``Charge Flips'' in
Tables~\ref{tab:yield_baseline} to~\ref{tab:yield_ht320met120}).

\item The data-driven sum of single fakes (SF) and double fakes
(DF) predictions (row ``SF$+$DF''
in Tables~\ref{tab:yield_baseline} to~\ref{tab:yield_ht320met120}).

\item The total MC prediction for processes that naturally give isolated
same-sign dileptons, see Section~\ref{sec:bkgds} (row ``MC Pred'' in
Tables~\ref{tab:yield_baseline} to~\ref{tab:yield_ht320met120};
this is the sum of the rows starting from ``$V\gamma$'' down to 
and including the tribosons -- although in practice only $ttW$ and 
$ttZ$ matter).  Note that for the dominant physics 
backgrounds we normalized the MC to $\sigma(pp \to ttW) = 0.1633 \pm 0.082$
pb and $\sigma(pp \to ttZ) = 0.139 \pm 0.070$ pb.

\end{enumerate}

Details on the systematics of the background predictions are given in the corresponding sections.
The final estimates on these uncertainties are rather simple:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The charge flip contribution has a 20\% systematic.
  \item The predicted number of fakes has a 50\% systematic in all modes.
  \item The MC prediction for ``real'' same-sign isolated dileptons
    has an uncertainty of 50\%.
  
\end{enumerate}

The background estimations in all signal regions
are in a good agreement with the observation.  We see no evidence of 
a contribution beyond Standard Model expectations.
We also note that the background with respect to the inclusive same-sign
dilepton search is suppressed by about
an order of magnitude due to the $b$-tag requirements.
As seen in the yield tables above, the 
contribution from fake leptons from b-quark decays in \ttbar,
which is the dominant in the pre-tagged sample analysis~\cite{ssnote2011},
is now suppressed and is no longer a dominant one.
This confirms our initial expectation from requiring two $b$-tagged jets.
The $H_T$ and \met~ distributions of the 10 events 
in the baseline region,
together with the background expectations, are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:htvsmet} and~\ref{fig:htmet}.
