\section{Event Yields and Background Estimation}
\label{sec:yields}

The results of this search in the above-mentioned kinematical region are summerized in Table~\ref{tab:ssyields1}.
As mentioned in the introduction, and quantified by this table, SM background is expected to be dominated by $t\bar{t}$ production
with one real and one fake lepton.
We estimate this background from the data itself using the ``Tight-To-Loose ratio'' (Fake Rate) method~\cite{frmethod}.
Electron charge mis-reconstruction is estimated by weighting opposite-sign dilepton events that pass all our cuts
by a charge flip rate obtained form single electron Monte Carlo as described in detail in~\cite{ssnote2011}.
The probability for muons to be reconstructed with the wrong sign in the relevant momemtum range is negligible.
Both of these techniques are described in more detail in~\cite{ssnote2011}.
Systematic errors on these two estimates are 50\% and 25\% respectively.

The estimation
is in a good agreement with the observation. 
We also note that the backgrounds with respect to the inclusive same-sign
dilepton search is suppressed by an order of magnitude due to the b-tag requirements.
As seen in the yield tables above, the contribution from fake leptons from $b$-quark decays in \ttbar,
which is the dominant in the pre-tagged sample analysis~\cite{ssnote2011},
is now suppressed and is no longer a dominant one.
This confirms our initial expectation from requiring two b-tagged jets.




%%Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:ttbar_residual} shows the minimum $\Delta R$ between one of the two b-tagged jets and 
%%the fake lepton in the MC after 
%%relaxing the jet veto cone around the lepton. 
%%The black line indicates the jet veto cone size. Clearly, a b-quark can not simultaneously provide a b-tag and an isolated lepton.

{\bf This section is missing two things. 
First, we will add a \met\ vs $H_T$ plot that shows the data and
one of the models overlayed. 
Second, we will add a summary of the events we see.
