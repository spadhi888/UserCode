\section{Event Yields and Background Estimation}
\label{sec:yields}

In the following Tables~\ref{tab:yieldBase_hpt} to~\ref{tab:yieldsnu_hpt} summarize the background estimates and compare them to the
observed counts of events in data for the baseline and search region selections
defined in Sections~\ref{sec:eventsel} and~\ref{sec:regions}.
In each table the expectations from the simulation alone are given in the upper part,
these overall are used to get a feeling of the expected contributions.
Of these, only backgrounds with actual final state same-sign leptons are used for the final result
as described in Section~\ref{sec:bkgds}.
The lower part of each table is the main result of the analysis
used for comparisons with data and setting constraints on various models.
These include the predictions for the fake-lepton and charge misidentification
bacgrounds derived as descibed in Section~\ref{sec:datadriven}.

Details on the systematics of the background predictions are given in the corresponding sections.
The final estimates on these uncertainties are rather simple:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the simulated backgrounds (from $V\gamma$ down to and including the tribosons) have a total
    uncertainty of 50\%;
  \item the predicted number of fakes has a 50\% systematics in all modes;
  \item the charge flip contribution has a 20\% systematics.
\end{itemize}

The estimation
is in a good agreement with the observation. 
We also note that the backgrounds with respect to the inclusive same-sign
dilepton search is suppressed by an order of magnitude due to the b-tag requirements.
As seen in the yield tables above, the contribution from fake leptons from $b$-quark decays in \ttbar,
which is the dominant in the pre-tagged sample analysis~\cite{ssnote2011},
is now suppressed and is no longer a dominant one.
This confirms our initial expectation from requiring two b-tagged jets.


{\bf This section is missing two things. 
First, we will add a \met\ vs $H_T$ plot that shows the data and
one of the models overlayed. 
Second, we will add a summary of the events we see.
