\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Calculations of higher-order cross-sections for several SM processes in $pp$ 
collisions at 7 TeV are provided in this note. The cross-sections are 
computed using the FEWZ and MCFM calculators for a given choice of parameters. 
The dominant systematic uncertainties on the cross-sections are due to the 
uncertainties in the PDFs, which are typically of the order of ($y1-y2$)\% on 
the total cross sections. The scale uncertainties within the variation 
of $1/2 \mu_0 < \mu_R, \mu_F < 2\mu_0$ are found to be at ($x1-x2$)\% level.
