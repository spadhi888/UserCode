\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Calculations of higher-order cross sections for several SM processes in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV are provided 
in this note. The cross sections are computed using the FEWZ and MCFM calculators for a given choice of parameters.
The dominant systematic errors on the cross sections are due to the uncertainities in the PDFs, which 
are typically of the order of ($y1-y2$) \% on the total cross sections. The scale uncertanities within 
the variation of $1/2 \mu_0 < \mu_R, \mu_F < 2\mu_0$ are found to be at ($x1-x2$) \% level.
