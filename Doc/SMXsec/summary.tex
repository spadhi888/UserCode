\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This note provides some calculations of higher-order cross-sections for 
several SM processes in $pp$ collisions at 7 TeV. The cross-sections are 
computed using the FEWZ and MCFM calculators as a reference for a given choice 
of input parameters and a consistent choice of PDF. Guidelines on how these
numbers should be used in the analyses to calculate K-factors have also 
been given. 
The dominant systematic uncertainties on the cross-sections are due to the 
uncertainties in the PDFs, which are typically of the order of ($y1-y2$)\%. 
The scale uncertainties within the variation 
of $1/2 \mu_0 < \mu_R, \mu_F < 2\mu_0$ are found to be at ($x1-x2$)\% level.
