\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The LHC has recently started delivering proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. 
Physics analyses at the LHC frequently depend on various inputs from theory that are only known with
limited accuracy. An important parameter to compare simulations and data is the predicted cross section for the former. The cross section calculations depend on various orders of perturbation theory
as well as the determination of PDFs. 

Most often there is no unique choice of which prescription should be used in 
a given analysis when comparing the simulations to the data. This study aims at establishing a convention as well 
as a certain set of choices based on inputs from the Monte Carlo simulations that are currently being used in the 
CMS collaboration. The higher order cross sections are then computed using these choices, and  
uncertanities due to the underlining assumptions are also computed.

In Section~\ref{sec:normalization}, guidelines for the calculation of K-factors based on higher order cross sections
along with given scales and PDF uncertainties are provided. In Section~\ref{sec:assumptions}
the assumptions made for these calculations are given, followed by the results in Section~\ref{sec:results}
and finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we summarize the results.
