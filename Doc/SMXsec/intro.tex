\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The LHC has recently started delivering proton-proton collisions at a 
centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Physics analyses at the LHC often depend 
on various inputs from theory that are only known with limited accuracy. The 
predictions on process cross sections are a well known example; their 
accuracy depend on the order of perturbation theory of the calculation and
the PDFs used. 

Most often there is no unique prescription of what calculation and what input 
settings should be used in a given analysis when comparing to the data. 
This study makes use of certain conventions, suggested by the 
Monte Carlo simulations used in CMS, in performing the computations of
higher order cross sections, along with the determination of the associated
errors, and aims at establishing common reference values for most relevant
SM cross sections which analyses can refer to.

This note is organised as follows:
in Section~\ref{sec:normalization}, guidelines for the calculation of K-factors 
based on higher order cross sections, along with given scales and PDF 
uncertainties, are provided. In Section~\ref{sec:assumptions} the assumptions 
made for these calculations are given, followed by the results in 
Section~\ref{sec:results}. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, the 
results are summarized.
