In order to use this isawig with different masses.

Find below the proceduce

1. ./sneutrino 

2. This requires following parameters.

Input the name of the slha file to be generated, followed by [ENTER]:

10000 260 600
Input Mu (Higgsino mass) and TANBETA, separated by a single space, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 10
Input MeR, MeL, and MQ (Left and Right Handed Slepton and Squark Masses) separated by single spaces, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 120 600
Input MtauR, MtauL, MBR, BTR, MQ3 (Left and Right Handed Stau, Right handed Sbottom, and Stop, and Stop-Sbottom Doublet Masses) separated by single spaces, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 120 600 600 600
 ENTER output file name (in single quotes)
 ENTER SUSY Les Houches Accord filename [/ for none]:
 ENTER Isawig (Herwig interface) filename [/ for none]:
 ENTER M(TP)
 ENTER M(GLSS), MU, M(A), TAN(BETA)
 ENTER M(Q1), M(DR), M(UR), M(L1), M(ER)
 ENTER M(Q3), M(BR), M(TR), M(L3), M(LR), A_T, A_B, A_L

 ENTER OPTIONAL GAUGINO MASSES M1, M2 (/ FOR DEFAULT):
 ENTER OPTIONAL GRAVITINO MASS (/ FOR DEFAULT):


3. The output is a slha file which can be used with using pythia for simulation

4. Parameters and the assumption used the sneutrinos

1. msquark = mgluino
2. Wino is heavier than sneutrino
3. mgluino > wino
4. tanbeta = 10
5. Input mass for left handed sleptons.

Input the name of the slha file to be generated, followed by [ENTER]:
test1
Input M1, M2, and M3 (Bino, Wino, and Gluino masses) separated by single spaces, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 130 600
Input Mu (Higgsino mass) and TANBETA, separated by a single space, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 10
Input MeR, MeL, and MQ (Left and Right Handed Slepton and Squark Masses) separated by single spaces, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 120 600
nput MtauR, MtauL, MBR, BTR, MQ3 (Left and Right Handed Stau, Right handed Sbottom, and Stop, and Stop-Sbottom Doublet Masses) separated by single spaces, followed by [ENTER]:
10000 120 600 600 600

This will result with:
snuetrino mass ~ 100 GeV
slepton mass ~ 128 GeV
Chargino/neutralino mass ~ 130 GeV.
Gluino/squark mass ~600 GeV
