\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have studied two different data driven methods to predict the backgrounds for  
searches beyond the standard model, in events with high $P_T$ same sign dileptons
($e$ or $\mu$), significant hadronic activity, and high \met~. 
For these searches, the dominant background is from \ttbar. We characterized
the background into different types based on charge mis-identification,
leptons from heavy flavor sources, as well as fake leptons.

We used the charge-flip rate method to predict the number of wrongly charged 
leptons. The fakes including leptons from heavy flavor sources are predicted 
using lepton fake rates. The prediction using the methods is shown to work 
for the considered SM samples. Using both methods on the ensemble of the
SM and SUSY samples, we show sensitivity towards several SUSY benchmark 
points using 100 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.
